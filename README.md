- #### React-toastify:
Often, while we are developing our applications, we want to inform the user of success or error messages after some action is taken.
Natively by Javascript itself, we could display it through window.alert, but let's face it, it's not the most elegant way to be followed!
Thinking about it, there are several libraries that help us in this simple task and today we are going to talk about one developed for React, called React-tostify!

- #### Reactstrap:
Reactstrap is a popular frontend library which is easy to use React Bootstrap 4 components. This library contains stateless React components
for Bootstrap 4. The Button component allows the user to perform actions and make choices with a single tap. We can use the following approach in ReactJS
to use the ReactJS Reactstrap button component.
